Tomorrow is a great day of celebration for the Tu'Hrese people: Solaris Rae'gis *[Common rough translation: The Day where Sun is King]*

The day will be filled with festivities: magic showcases, exotic foods & all!
The festival centers around the choosing of the nation's next leader (the Rae'Sol) among the royal families

Since one of the early royal decrees of Rae'Sol Shaheen el Tu'Hra,
the choosing ceremony is performed with the aid of a unique spell, said to be given to the Rae'Sol by Solaris ("Personification" of the sun in Tu'Hrese culture)
The spell is in itself a test of worth. The royal singled out by the spell is deemed worthy in the eyes of the current Rae'Sol

This is the second time this ceremony will ever be performed, the first time being for the coronation of Rae'Sol Shaheen el Tu'Hra

The festivities will last from dawn till dusk, and there's much to see!
