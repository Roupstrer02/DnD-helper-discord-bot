Early this week, Emperor Céleste Delacroix III addressed the commonfolk of the Spark of Dawn from the capital city of Embermoore.

The emperor addressed the pressing topics that plagued the empire in the recent past.
He answered many of the burning questions of the commonfolk, and rallied the empire
towards what many Tu'Hrese and Ilis scholars are calling the most catastrophic clash of power since the shattering:

"
*Today, a great tragedy has befallen our glorious empire.
Our history, our knowledge, our past and our future were burned into cinders.
After careful investigation,
we can confidently declare that the flames that burned our great library were of MAGICAL origin!...
We can also confirm that the assailants were allied with Zanthar and seeked to destroy our future!
These zantharian scum have gone too far.
This is a declaration of war! We head for Zanthar TODAY!

Long Live the Empire!

Long Live the Emperor!

Long Live the Dawn!*
"

-- Emperor Céleste Delacroix III
