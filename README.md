# DnD helper discord bot
  A Dungeons & Dragons discord bot that helps run games, recall rules, and improve players' overall experience playing the game

## Rolling Dice
By typing "!roll" at the start of a message, players can write out a sequence of dice they'd like to roll (whether the dice are real or not)

e.g "!roll 3d20 2d10 3d8 2d57"

## Sharing Spells and descriptions
By typing "!spell" at the start of a message, players can make the bot scrape the web and display the effects of a certain spell

e.g "!spell fireball"

## Sharing Spells and descriptions
By typing "!news" at the start of a message, players can see fictional news articles from different parts of the world they're playing in that the DM can customize

e.g "!news Tu'Hra" (Tu'Hra is the name of a city in my personal D&D campaign)
